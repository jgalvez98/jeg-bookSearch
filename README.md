# jeg-bookSearch

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a full-stack application that allows users to search for books and manage a personal list of favorite books. This project refactors an existing RESTful API-based search engine into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to deliver a seamless book searching and saving experience.
